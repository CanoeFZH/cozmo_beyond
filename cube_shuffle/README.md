# Cube Shuffle

### How to play

Show cozmo three cubes. When they start flashing blue, tap one. That's your cube!
Shuffle them all around as cozmo trys to follow the cubes. Stop after a few seconds, then he will make a guess.


### Suggestions/Improvments

I'm open for comments on how to make it more fun/clear. For instance, when do we stop shuffling? Right now it's a hardcoded thing, and we don't really tell friend.
